Read more about how we evaluate products. Black Friday is almost here, but we wouldn't blame you if you've felt like it's been here for a while. What was once a one-day event filled with limited-time deals has grown into a month-long event with a plethora of sales to sift through each day. This year, Amazon, Target, Best Buy and Walmart and several other retailers kicked off their Black Friday deals early, with some starting as soon as late October. If you're overwhelmed by the amount of discounts showing up in your feeds, you're not alone. To help, we at Engadget have collected all of the best Black Friday deals you can shop right now, primarily on tech we've tested and reviewed. These are the best tech deals you can get this year, on the gadgets we know to be worth your money. There's a possibility we'll see slightly lower prices on Black Friday proper — but with each passing day, that likelihood becomes less and less as even more early Black Friday deals pop up across the web. We'll be updating our list regularly in the lead-up to Black Friday, so check back to catch all of the latest Black Friday deals.",
