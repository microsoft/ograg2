Last year's winter meetings wound up being explosive. Aaron Judge, Justin Verlander, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts all came away with new contracts. This year's winter meetings could wind up being similarly busy. There is a growing sense Shohei Ohtani could sign during the winter meetings, and a move of that magnitude could kick off the next wave of moves. There's also a number of top players on the trade market, including star Padres outfielder Juan Soto. Starting Sunday, Dec. 3, and running through Wednesday, Dec. 6, expect MLB's offseason to really kick into high gear.",
