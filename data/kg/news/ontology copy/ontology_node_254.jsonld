            "summary": "Breathtaking is fair. Like the ABBA Voyage show in London, it is hard to capture in words. In many ways, it’s a conventional space: there is tiered seating inside, and wallet-bruising bar snacks and merchandise for sale outside. Some parts of the rock concert experience will never change. But when the lights go down, everything changes. Around you, Sphere splits open to reveal a succession of environments, each more stunning than the one before. Though the structure is familiar - the audience seated in rows, the band on a single, central stage - the effect is overwhelming. In U2’s show, we journey through a succession of environments referencing the band’s creative history. For other projects, such as Darren Aronofsky’s Postcard From Earth, the Sphere’s sound system uses “haptics” to make the audience feel the sounds. U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas.

There are 157,000 ultra-directional speakers – the boffins call it “beam-forming acoustics” – and there are “infrasound haptics”, which means the soundwaves are shaped to create both vibrations and waves of air pressure.",

But behind those screens are “a whole new kind of speaker,” Lipson says. “In a regular show, the speakers are at one end pushing the sound down the room, so it’s louder at the stage end and quieter further away. [But here] because everybody’s sort of getting their own feed, everybody’s getting an equal volume. So hearing the show in there, sonically, may be better than anywhere.”"
