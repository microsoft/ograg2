      "summary": "With the 2023 MLS season closing earlier than expected for Inter Miami, eliminated from playoff contention, Lionel Messi will have significant time off before the new campaign begins in February 2024. With every new season come preseason friendlies, as the players hope to ramp up their match fitness prior to the start of the coming campaign. Players need game time to build their bodies to the point where they can play full 90-minute matches, especially when they are contesting multiple games a week. Inter Miami's preseason will be watched with extra observation as Messi draws considerable attention wherever he goes, home or abroad. The Argentina star had looked like being part of a tour of China, although that's no longer the case, while the prospect of facing a familiar side from home is a tantalising one. The Sporting News has compiled all the known preseason matches either confirmed or reported prior to the start of Inter Miami's 2024 season.",
