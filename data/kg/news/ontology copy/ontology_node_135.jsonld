            "title": "Bills vs. Bengals live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game",
            "summary": "Folks, the Bengals are back. When Cincinnati began the season 1-3, including a pair of blowout losses in which they scored just three points in each game against the Browns and Titans, it sure seemed Joe Burrow's calf injury would wind up holding the team back in what appeared to be one of their best chances to finally win that elusive Super Bowl. Since that loss to Tennessee, it's been the Bengals of old. And that team showed up again on 'Sunday Night Football' against the Bills. Cincinnati jumped out to an first-half, 21-7 lead against Buffalo, and the defense did the rest, limiting the Bills to just 11 points the rest of the game as the Bengals won their fourth straight, beating the Bills 24-18. MORE: Is Damar Hamlin playing vs. Bengals on SNF? Fans expected this to be an offensive showdown against two premier quarterbacks. And after the first three drives of the game, it sure appeared that's how it would go. The Bengals scored an opening-drive touchdown on just nine plays, matched quickly by a Bills' scoring drive of seven plays and 3:15. The Bengals re-took the lead on a 5:28 scoring drive to wrap up the first. From there, however, 'Mad Scientist' Lou Anarumo's defense kept Josh Allen and the Bills off balance offensively for most of the remainder of the game. The next four drives of the half went punt, interception, punt, end of half. Burrow and the Bengals, meanwhile, hit a few bumps in Buffalo territory, but scored a touchdown on their final drive of of the first half to take a two-score lead into the locker room. Buffalo picked up a field goal on the first drive of the second half and held the Bengals to just three points in the second half, but it wasn't until 3:32 left that Allen finally got the Bills back into the end zone, with a 17-yard strike to Diggs and a subsequent 2-point try to make it a six-point game. MORE: Watch 'Sunday Night Football' live with Fubo (free trial) The Bengals had the ball back with 3:32 left, but put the trust in No. 9, having him start the put-away drive with a 32-yard deep shot to Tyler Boyd to put the Bengals quickly in Buffalo territory. Joe Mixon ran three times to pick up the final first down needed to allow Burrow to kneel out the contest. In a highly anticipated rematch between Allen and Burrow, it was the Bengals' signal-caller that once again came out the better in both the win column and the statsheet. Burrow completed 31-of-44 passes for 348 yards with a pair of touchdowns, while Allen went 26-for-38 with 258 passing yards, one passing touchdown and an interception. He also rushed eight times for 44 yards and another score. With the win, the Bengals move into the final wild-card spot behind the Steelers and Browns, while the Bills are bumped down to the outside-looking-in of the AFC playoff race.

The Bengals can kneel the game out and will win 24-18. 11:19 p.m.: Mixon rushes for four yards to bring up a third-and-4 at the Bills' 37, and bring up the two-minute warning. A first down will win the game for the Bengals, since Buffalo cannot stop the clock. A stop on third will bring up an interesting decision for Zac Taylor and Cincinnati. 11:17 p.m.: Mixon rushes for two yards after the big gain, and the Bills use their final timeout with 2:37 left. 11:17 p.m.: Feels like a time to run the ball, right? Well, not to the Bengals, who trust Burrow to air out a deep pass to Boyd for 32 yards to the Bills 43. Burrow and Boyd get the @Bengals past midfield on the first play of the drive ðŸ“º: #BUFvsCIN on NBC ðŸ“±: Stream on #NFLPlus https://t.co/T6GLEfxpQv pic.twitter.com/SOTyFnyzp7 â€” NFL (@NFL) November 6, 2023 11:16 p.m.: Bengals start the drive at the 25. 11:13 p.m. Bills scoring play: There's the big strike Bills fans have been waiting for. Allen fires a deep shot to Diggs, who beat rookie corner DJ Turner for the 17-yard touchdown. The Bills convert on the two-point conversion, throwing again to Diggs to make it a six-point game. Bengals 24, Bills 18 11:12 p.m.: Bills move quickly into the red zone, as Allen connects with Shakir for three yards then a short pass to Murray for six yards. Third-and-1 at the Bengals' 17 with under four minutes to play. 11:11 p.m.: Another familiar pattern for the Bills: Sherfield catches a pass for nine yards, then Murray powers ahead for two to pick up the first down at the Bengals' 26. 11:11 p.m.: The call on the field stands: incomplete pass. Bills face second-and-10, trailing by 14 with 5:33 left and only one timeout left on the board. 11:08 p.m.: Allen scrambles right again, and gets 11 yards. His next play is rules incomplete on a pass that just skips in too low for Sherfield. The Bills are challenging the play. 11:05 p.m.: Allen hits Shakir for a quick pass, and his speedy receiver takes it up for nine, but Allen is rushed on the next play and fires out an incompletion to avoid the sack from Hubbard. Latavius Murray gets his first carry and picks up two and the first down to the Bengals' 48. 11:04 p.m.: Allen goes right back to his trusted tight end, even after the fumble, with Kincaid catching a nine-yard pass to start the drive. Allen then runs right, dodging a tackle from Sam Hubbard, to pick up seven and the first at the Bills' 41. 11:03 p.m.: Bills will take the touchback, and start the drive from the 25. 11 p.m. Bengals scoring play: Burrow misses Mixon trying to get him on a swing pass. Cincinnati opts for the field goal at the 2-yard line to make it a two-touchdown advantage with 8:08 left to play. Bengals 24, Bills 10 10:59 p.m.: Another toss play outside to Mixon goes for a loss of three, but Burrow finds Smith, who picks up eight yards to the Bills' 2 before he steps out of bounds. Third-and-goal at the 2, with the Bengals knocking on the door. 10:57 p.m.: Burrow to Higgins has been the top combination all night, and it is again on the third down play. They connect for 18 yards, with Higgins catching a slant and races it to the Buffalo 7. First-and-goal with less than 10 minutes to play. 10:56 p.m.: Mixon picks up four yards on a run up the middle, but Burrow throws the ball away on the second-and-6. Bengals use their third and final timeout with 10:19 left before a third-and-6 play. 10:53 p.m.: Burrow finally connects on the big shot to Chase. His star wide receiver finds some open space, and he catches a 32-yard pass up to the Bills' 29. 10:52 p.m.: Why run it on third-and-1, when Burrow can call a play action then connect with Hudson for 17 yards up to the Cincinnati 39. Tanner Hudson had 4 total catches this season entering today. He has 4 in this game alone ðŸ˜±",
