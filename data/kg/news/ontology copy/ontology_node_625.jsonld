The veteran hurler has enjoyed quite the campaign in 2024, turning back the clock with ruthless efficiency while leading Tampa Bay to the top of the NFC South totem pole. Mayfield has quietly emerged as one of the league's best passers this year, entering the Bucs' Week 15 matchup with the Packers with a hair under 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns to just eight interceptions. He kept the good times rolling on Sunday, shredding Joe Barry's Packers defense to keep the Bucs strumming along towards a divisional crown with a 34-20 win.",

It was the finest display of Mayfield's season and one of the best of his career. It's also one of the greatest showings in recent Lambeau Field history; according to ESPN Stats and Info, Mayfield is just the sixth opposing QB to toss for at least 350 yards and four touchdowns in a single game there."
