Passan reported that at least three teams initially believed to be in the running — the Mets, Rangers and Red Sox — are believed to be out now. The teams most likely to still be in the mix are the Dodgers, Cubs, Blue Jays and Angels, with the Giants' status in the race for Ohtani unknown.",

Passan reported a trade of Soto appears to be 'edging closer to becoming a reality,' and while several teams are out on him because of his large salary and pending free-agent status, there still could be a large market for the star outfielder. Much of the rest of the names on the trade market are arms. Dylan Cease and Tyler Glasnow are the pitchers most likely to be dealt this offseason, and Cleveland could also hold a pair of intriguing trade chips in closer Emmanuel Clase and former Cy Young winner Shane Bieber. The Brewers have also begun trade talks for former Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes.",
