The Second City Saint was released from the Jacksonville-based promotion back in September 2023 due to his backstage altercation with Jack Perry at AEW All In 2023. Following this, there have been multiple speculations about what might be the former WWE star’s next move. While he has been dropping multiple hints sparking rumors, fans are particularly inclined that he might return to his old stomping ground, WWE.",

The promos which started several weeks ago, show Nakamura calling out to someone that he wants to have a duel with. The mystery opponent has not been revealed yet and according to reports, talents at WWE are pretty clueless as well. However, fans were pretty fast to decode who might be his opponent. At the fallout episode of Raw following Fastlane, Nakamura was particularly frustrated due to his loss against Seth Rollins."

Even though they were in the same promotion, the two never got a chance to spar. But Rhodes and Punk had a bout in WWE a while back during their initial days. The two had brawled on a couple of occasions. One was during a tag team match with his tag-team partner Ted Debiase Jr. The then World Tag Team Champions lost their title to CM Punk and his partner Kofi Kingston."
