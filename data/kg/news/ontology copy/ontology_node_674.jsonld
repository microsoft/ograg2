            "summary": "Dillon Danis has been going back and forth with the Paul family long before his upcoming fight against Logan Paul, scheduled for October 14th. At the moment, Danis is preparing hard for his Misfits contest, as he’s tried to get in the head of his opponent leading up to the bout. As a result, Danis has garnered over a million followers on X. ‘El Jefe’ has been trying to dig up the past relationships of Logan Paul’s fiancée, Nina Agdal, as a way to create turmoil in Paul’s mindset during the fight. However, this beef was first started by Logan Paul’s younger brother, Jake Paul. He called out Danis on his Instagram story in 2020, by taking a hit at his rumored ex-girlfriend, Savannah Montano. So Danis’s target at Agdal could have a revenge angle that many didn’t know about. Even Logan addressed the topic of Montano and Jake during their first press conference. So, who is this girl? What’s the actual story here?",
