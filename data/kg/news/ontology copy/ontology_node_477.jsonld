            "summary": "Nine-men Tottenham suffered their first loss of the Premier League campaign in a fiery 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea. Jackson rifled in a 75th minute winner from Raheem Sterling’s square-ball pass as the Blues came from behind to win at manager – Mauricio Pochettino’s former home ground – with the Argentinean having managed Spurs between 2014-19. The Senegal forward then struck twice in injury time to claim his first hat-trick as a Chelsea player and wrap up a clinical victory. Dejan Kulusevski had earlier put Tottenham ahead in the sixth minute but Cole Palmer equalised from a 35th minute penalty, after Cristian Romero had been red carded for a foul on Enzo Fernandez. The hosts’ disastrous evening worsened with injuries to Mickey van de Ven and James Maddison, whilst Destiny Udogie was sent off in the 55th minute for a second bookable offence. Speaking to BBC post-match, Tottenham manager, Ange Postecoglou said: “There was a fair bit going on, a lot of VAR intervention, a hard game for me to analyse but I am very proud of the players. Right to the end they were trying to create something for us. “The players couldn’t give any more than they did, part of this game is will, effort and determination and they showed that.” Tottenham now sit second in the table, whilst Chelsea’s win lifted them up to tenth on goal difference from fellow London rivals, Crystal Palace.",
