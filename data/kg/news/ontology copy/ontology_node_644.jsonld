      "summary": "England’s hopes of defending their World Cup crown are in tatters – and we’re barely halfway through the 2023 tournament. Second-last of ten on the table after a fourth abject loss in barely three weeks, this time by eight wickets and nearly 25 overs to spare against Sri Lanka having been bowled out for a miserable 156 in Bengaluru, the 2019 champions are now only mathematically a chance of scraping through to the semi-finals. They need not only to somehow turn their horrendous form around to win all four of their remaining matches, including an upcoming date with table-toppers and tournament favourites India, but also to hope numerous other results, including Australia to lose at least two and probably three of its own four games, to reach the knockout stage.",
