Apart from the food - arguably the main component of the day - the holiday is a beloved time of year when Americans come together to celebrate what they are thankful for, either with family or friends. In America, Thanksgiving is a cultural holiday that symbolises peace, thankfulness, and the beginning of the holiday season.",

The later feast was in honour of the help the Pilgrims received from the Native Americans in cultivating crops and surviving their first harsh winter and it lasted three days.",
