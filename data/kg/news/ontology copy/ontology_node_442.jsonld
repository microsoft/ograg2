Although fantasy's highest-scoring position has been beaten and battered this year, there are serviceable signal-callers out there capable of leading your team to victory in a pivotal week. Our Week 14 fantasy QB rankings will help you make the right start 'em, sit 'em moves to cap off the regular season. We're still dealing with byes -- and we had two more QB injuries last week -- but the position remains deep with high-scoring studs and potential sleepers. As we saw last week, we're at the point in the season where weather could factor into start-sit decisions, but finding quarterback production shouldn't be a problem in 10- and 12-team leagues. With that in mind, let's dissect this week's QB rankings and put you on a path to end your season with a 'W.'",
