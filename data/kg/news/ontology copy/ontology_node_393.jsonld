You’ll still have to spend money on snacks, but not nearly as much. A high-quality home cinema setup summons the most compelling parts of the silver screen into your own living room.

The Netgear Powerline helps to mitigate these issues by creating a power plug-based tether between your router and your devices. Each Powerline adapter features an ethernet port, letting you use your home’s electrical lines as an internet pathway. Clever! Just plug one in near your router and connect an ethernet cable, then use another adapter near the device that you want to hard-wire."
