A win on Monday night against the suddenly reeling Eagles could be a big boost in their chances going forward -- a matchup that is actually a pretty good one after looking beneath the surface. The Eagles come in as losers of two straight, losing in blowout fashion both times no less. Suddenly the sky is falling as the Cowboys have taken over the NFC East division lead, complicating matters as the regular season winds down. The sense of urgency for both sides means we are looking at two teams with plenty to lose, setting up for a fun Monday night under the lights at Lumen Field.",
