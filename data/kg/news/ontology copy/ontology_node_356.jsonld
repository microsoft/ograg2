Alongside the government’s thrust on ramping up renewable energy capacity, building incremental thermal capacity has also been a priority. This is because energy security has become an important issue with consistent increase in demand in recent years; power demand is now at all-time high/peak levels. PSU thermal major NTPC appears to be well-placed to capture both themes — energy transition and energy security.",
