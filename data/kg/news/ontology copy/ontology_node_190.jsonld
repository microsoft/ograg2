      "summary": "Without Lionel Messi, Inter Miami have looked exceedingly mortal. They put in a 90-minute performance littered with individual mistakes, and the Chicago Fire made them pay, winning 4-1 via braces from Xherdan Shaqiri and substitute Maren Haile-Selassie. The result boosts Chicago’s postseason hopes significantly, moving them into a playoff position in the Eastern Conference standings. Inter Miami’s playoff hopes, conversely, are now on life support, needing to win out in their final three games and get outside help. The club is winless in four games with Messi out injured, and it has seen their chances at a postseason berth nearly evaporate. Shaqiri’s brace was the biggest talking point for the hosts, as the former Liverpool midfielder has not always been at his best since joining MLS, but in front of a record Chicago Fire crowd at Soldier Field, he rose to the occasion. The Sporting News followed the Chicago Fire vs. Inter Miami match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.",
