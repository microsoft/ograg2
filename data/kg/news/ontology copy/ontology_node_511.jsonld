      "summary": "This week might not matter for many fantasy football owners. Some have secured their spot in the postseason; others are well out of contention. However, for those in must-win situations, this week really matters. It's not the time to have a hole in your lineup at tight end, but if you do, we're here to help with our Week 14 fantasy TE PPR rankings. Fortunately, there are several solid sleepers and streaming options despite two tough byes and some big injuries to notable TEs. It's always tough to know who to trust at this volatile position, so we break down which tight ends have higher floors for those favored to win comfortably and which have higher ceilings for those who need to really shoot for big points. Let's get to it and check out the TE landscape for Week 14.",
