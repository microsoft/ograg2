            "summary": "All eyes since the start of the offseason have been on Shohei Ohtani. And for the most part, there hasn't been much to see. The two-way phenom is the most sought-after free agent in MLB history, with his combination of talent and marketability making him a franchise-changing player. And the bidding for Ohtani could be winding down soon. Multiple reports have indicated Ohtani could sign at some point during the winter meetings, which are scheduled to take place from Dec. 3 through Dec. 6. Many of the top teams are expected to be in the mix for Ohtani. The Dodgers and Cubs are among the top teams expected to be aiming to sign the two-time AL MVP, and plenty of others should continue to compete through the end to land him. Here's the latest on Ohtani's free agency pursuits.",

It's a colossal 10-year, $700 million deal with 'significant deferrals,' so while Los Angeles won't pay him $70 million per year, the franchise will be paying him beyond those 10 seasons.

The New York Post's Jon Heyman reported there could be some changes if Ohtani signs with the Blue Jays, however, reporting that some rivals believe Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. could hit the trade block if Toronto lands the star. Trading the two infielders might seem counterproductive to signing Ohtani in the first place. Those two would be the biggest supporting bats in the lineup around Ohtani. However, both are free agents after the 2025 season, and given the added payroll of signing Ohtani, it's possible Toronto would view keeping the other two phenoms as too pricey.",
