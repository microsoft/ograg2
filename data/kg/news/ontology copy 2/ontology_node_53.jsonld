      "content": "If you tuned into 'Sunday Night Football' expecting to see some offense, you tuned in on the wrong weekend. The Jets and Raiders were locked into an old-school, defense-heavy primetime clash that featured nothing but six field goals through the first three quarters of the game. It wasn't until 50 seconds into the fourth quarter that Las Vegas finally picked up the first touchdown, with Michael Mayer making a leaping grab in the end zone to put the Raiders up 16-9. In such a low-scoring game, that touchdown felt, even as early as it was, that it could be a game-winner. And indeed, it was as the Raiders held the Jets to just a field goal the rest of the game and picked off Zach Wilson late to stymy New York in a 16-12 win. MORE: What to know about Raiders 'SNF' hero Robert Spillane It wasn't exactly a quarterback showdown that many might have expected in the preseason when this game appeared to be Aaron Rodgers vs. Jimmy Garoppolo. Instead, Wilson went 23-for-39 with 263 yards, no touchdowns and a pick (rushing four times for 54 yards) while Aidan O'Connell completed 16-of-27 passes for 153 yards, a touchdown and an interception. The Raiders largely turned to running back Josh Jacobs, who set season-best marks with 27 carries for 116 yards, while the Jets' running back duo of Breece Hall and Dalvin Cook was held to just 17 rushes for 54 yards. The win for the Raiders already marks their second in as many games since the firing of Josh McDaniels, with interim coach Antonio Pierce getting off to an undefeated 2-0 start to his career. It also vaults the Raiders into a deep AFC playoff race, with Las Vegas joining the now five AFC wild-card contenders with at least five wins. For the Jets, it marked a second straight game without a touchdown, and gives them their second consecutive loss before hitting the road to face the Bills in Week 11.
