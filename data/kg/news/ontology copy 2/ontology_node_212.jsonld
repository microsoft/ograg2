      "content": "It was all Seahawks on “Monday Night Football” as the team turned in a dominant defensive effort en route to a 24-3 win over the Giants to wrap up Week 4 of the NFL season. In addition to sacking Daniel Jones 11 times, Seattle’s defense forced New York’s QB to commit three turnovers — a fumble and two interceptions, none more notable than rookie Devon Witherspoon's 97-yard pick-6 that turned the game on its ear. With the win, the Seahawks move to 3-1 on the season, including a perfect 2-0 record away from home. The Giants drop to 1-3 on the season and have been outscored 64-3 in two primetime home losses. The Sporting News tracked score updates and highlights from throughout Monday night's meeting between New York and Seattle.",
