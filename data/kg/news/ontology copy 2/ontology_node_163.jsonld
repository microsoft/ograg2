Read more about how we evaluate products. Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been having a moment recently. Massive marketing budgets and influencer collaborations have convinced consumers that a VPN’s functionality and privacy features will solve all of their security woes. However, it’s not as cut-and-dry as that. VPNs are just one part of a robust online security routine, but given the number of VPN services out there today, it can be hard to figure out which one will be right for you. Not to mention that you often have to dig through claims of attributes that aren’t always totally accurate to get to that answer. We tested out nine of the best VPN services available now and landed on five top picks that should suit most people's needs.",
