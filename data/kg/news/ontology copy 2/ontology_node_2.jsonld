Apple's Cyber Monday Promotion Apple notoriously doesn't run sales on its own storefront. However, it does usually throw in a gift card for Apple Store credit if you purchase select items. This year, now through November 27, you can get up to $200 in Apple Store credit to use later if you purchase certain items. For example, if you buy an iPhone 14 or iPhone SE, you can get up to $75 in store credit. Buy a MacBook Air and you'll get up to $200. You can find the full list here. Separately, there's also a sale on Apple gift cards on Amazon. Each one has a unique corresponding coupon code that you can see on this page. For example, you can get a $100 Apple Gift Card and a free $15 Amazon credit with code APPLET5USAP. There are tons of cards to choose from. You can browse them all here.
