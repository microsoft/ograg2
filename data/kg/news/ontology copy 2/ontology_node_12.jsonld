      "theme": "sports",
      "content": "On the field, Michigan is in the midst of what could be a historic season. Off the field, the focus has rarely been on the team's success. An investigation into Michigan's alleged sign-stealing scheme, centered on now-fired staffer Connor Stalions, continues to evolve by the hour, with one update after another adding another wrinkle to the saga that began in October. The Big Ten suspended coach Jim Harbaugh for three games on Friday with the team on a plane en route to Penn State, and although Michigan had hoped to block the suspension, the Wolverines will be without their coach on the sidelines in Happy Valley. The Sporting News is tracking the latest updates from the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. Follow along with the newest developments below.",
