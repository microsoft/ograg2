      "title": "NFL Fantasy Football Week 5 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game",
      "author": "Dave Richard",
      "theme": "sports",
      "content": "Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out. It's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made. We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world. It's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected strength of schedule rankings every week over at SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.",

Buffalo is savvy when it comes to defending the pass, so I can't say they'll fall off just because star cornerback Tre'Davious White won't play, but I wonder just how effective its pass rush will be without Greg Rousseau and with a sub-100 percent Von Miller (if he plays). Lawrence is a decent starter but I'd rather roll with Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Justin Fields.",

The Jaguars have done well against deep-ball receivers but not enough to the point where benching Davis is a good idea. He's toward the top of the flex mix ahead of Tank Dell, Tutu Atwell, Christian Watson and Jerry Jeudy.",

For now he's among the TD-needy running back tier who might only give 13 or 14 PPR points even if he does score (which no one has done against Atlanta). He's more than fine as a bye-week replacement RB (or a RB who you kind of have to start because you're thin at the position) but I'd prefer Breece Hall, Isiah Pacheco and Rhamondre Stevenson over Pierce.",

And if the game is low-scoring or a one-sided win for Houston (don't laugh, they just did it last week), it further lowers Dell's ceiling. I'd rather start Romeo Doubs, Christian Watson and Adam Thielen.",

But it's hard to see the good in his game so far this season beyond him finding holes in zone coverage. Jonnu even has more red-zone targets than Pitts (by one, three to two). The matchup could create some receiving opportunities, so maybe he catches five passes for 50 yards, but that's not anything to be excited about. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson, Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert.",

The hope is we keep seeing that for Smith, especially if the game is competitive like most Falcons games tend to be. He certainly hasn't done anything to lose his role. I don't mind chancing it with Smith as a streaming tight end, though I just don't have the conviction to start him over Pitts.",

          "eventSummary": "Age: 23 • Experience: Rookie We've come to love (or hate) Ravens-Steelers games for their tough defense and low-scoring battles. That might hurt Flowers' chances of scoring -- it will probably take a little luck, which isn't necessarily too big of an ask given how the Steelers secondary has played recently. If you start Flowers, you're counting on the Steelers run defense staying strong and the Ravens using Flowers to create solid plays as a run-game extension and/or you're hoping for a splash play. That makes him a risky flex with a much safer floor in PPR than half- or non-PPR. In the catch-counting formats I'll start him over Tank Dell, the Broncos WRs, Jordan Addison and George Pickens.",
