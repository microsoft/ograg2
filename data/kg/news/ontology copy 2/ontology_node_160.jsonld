      "content": "Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have already found new homes, but much of the MLB offseason has yet to play out. Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto is the focus of many teams as he prepares to sign a massive deal, while Blake Snell, Cody Bellinger and Jordan Montgomery remain on the market. The trade market is also expected to be active once more dominoes fall, with Dylan Cease, Corbin Burnes and Tyler Glasnow among starters who could be moved this winter. The Winter Meetings are over, but because of the timeline of major decisions by Ohtani and Yamamoto, there could be a flurry of activity leading up to the end of the year. MORE: Why Shohei Ohtani signed with Dodgers over Blue Jays, other suitors. Sporting News is tracking the rumors, signings and trades as MLB free agency continues.
