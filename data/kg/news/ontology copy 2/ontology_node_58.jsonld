      "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products. Amazon's October Prime Day sale officially ended on Wednesday, but a few of the deals are still live as we head into the weekend. If you were hoping to check off a few more names from your holiday gift list or buy something for yourself at a discount, see what remains on sale below. We combed through our coverage over the past few days to find the best of what's left. While Amazon has returned most of their own devices, like Echos and Kindles, back to their full prices, a handful of products from other brands like Google, Samsung and Anker, have maintained the lows they hit on Prime Day. Here are the best deals from Prime Big Deal Days that you can still get right now.",
