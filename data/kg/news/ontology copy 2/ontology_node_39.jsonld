A 3-2 win in the second leg at BMO Field in Toronto allowed Jamaica to progress on away goals after a 4-4 aggregate tie across the two legs. After Canada opened the scoring through Alphonso Davies they held a comfortable 3-1 aggregate lead, but that advantage eroded in 15 second-half minutes as Jamaican striker Shamar Nicholson scored a brace, before Fulham attacker Bobby De Cordova-Reid converted the penalty that sealed progression. Canada will now have to defeat Trinidad and Tobago in a one-off playoff in March to reach the Copa America 2024 tournament to be hosted in the U.S. The Sporting News followed the Canada vs. Jamaica match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.",
