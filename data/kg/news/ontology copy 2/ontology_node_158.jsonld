      "content": "Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies, new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits, the streaming service’s firehose of content makes what’s coming and going difficult to parse. It’s a great month for adult animation, with both the Scott Pilgrim animated show and Blue Eye Samurai hitting Netflix this month. Also, there’s the Squid Game reality show — because right, that’s a thing — and a new season of The Crown. But this month, we’re highlighting The Social Network, with another new David Fincher movie on its way to Netflix... but not for the reasons you probably think. Editor’s Pick: The Social Network Hey, did you know that there’s a popular fan theory that bestselling romantic comedy Red, White, and Royal Blue started off as fanfic of The Social Network? Well, now you do! I could talk about how with each passing year, David Fincher’s Mark Zuckerberg biopic grows increasingly more relevant, as Facebook’s (excuse me, Meta’s) grip on the internet becomes stronger, but that’s been done to the death. Instead, I’m going to praise both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield for their electric performances and their zinging chemistry. Come for the Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg origin story, stay for the tale of doomed friendship (and maybe write a fanfic about it?). Also, this is a great November movie because of the autumnal shots of Harvard and the Winklevoss twins rowing. Impeccable vibes to fuel the dark academia aesthetic TikTok videos.",
