Even those just dipping their toes into the world of sports betting for the first time can quickly get a handle on the basics of the moneyline. On this page we'll unpack the ins and outs of moneyline betting in more detail. What is a moneyline bet? So, what's the essence of a moneyline bet? In this type of bet, the sole focus is identifying the winner. The victory margin and the total points scored have no bearing. It doesn't matter if your chosen team clinches a win with a score of 2-1 or a blowout of 50-0; the payout remains unchanged. In this way, the moneyline distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor. Every moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. In the context of moneyline betting, 'favorites' and 'underdogs' refer to the perceived stronger and weaker participants, respectively.",
