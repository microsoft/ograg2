      "content": "The Rangers continue to be unstoppable road warriors. Texas picked up its ninth consecutive road victory in these playoffs after defeating the Diamondbacks in Game 3 of the World Series, 3-1. The Rangers were powered by some two-out magic in the third inning, as Marcus Semien finally found his bat with an RBI single before Corey Seager demolished a two-run home run 421 feet to right field. Jon Gray got credited with the win after Max Scherzer was pulled from the contest with a lower back injury through three scoreless innings. Gray was fantastic in a surprise relief appearance, throwing three scoreless innings with three strikeouts and just one hit allowed. The Diamondbacks' offense struggled to string together hits and couldn't cash in when they had runners in scoring position. Even though they out-hit the Rangers, Arizona's bats hardly put any pressure on Texas' pitching.",
