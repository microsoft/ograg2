What type of soil is needed for growing wheat while avoiding sandy soil?,"[""{'Crop name': 'Wheat', 'Crop harvesting_guidelines_are': 'When the moisture level of grain is 25% it is the proper time for manual harvesting. Generally, wheat is manually harvested but for quick harvesting, combine harvester should be used to avoid losses in grain yield due to shattering and lodging. Wheat should be harvested 4-5 days before it is dead ripe. Morning is the best time for harvesting. Mechanical harvesting through combine machine is done at places where uniform ripening of wheat happens. In case of manual harvesting, bundles are made and dried for 3-4 days and threshed by thresher. Before storage, grain should be dried by spreading on tarpaulin plastic sheets in bright sunlight to a moisture level below 12%.', 'Crop storage_guidelines_are': 'For storage, use bins and silos made of GI sheets. Now a days, aluminium bins, Pusa bins, silos and poly lined bags are available for storage. Farmers can store wheat grains in their traditional storage as well. Improved storage structures of various capacities are now available. The air-tight bin can be used. It is so constructed that it does not allow entry of any outside insects and rodents and the insects present in the grain do not get favourable atmosphere to develop. For filling and using the metal bin, the following storage practices are recommended: Clean the bin thoroughly and do not allow the left-overs of the previously stored grains to remain in the bin. Inspect the covers to ensure that the gaskets are intact. Clean and sort the grains of all impurities. Broken kernels and other impurities lead to insect attraction and, hence, should be separated. Do not mix the new grains with old stock as the latter may be infested with insects. Never store infested grains, or grains with high moisture content. Dry the grains out in the sun, cool it and fill in the bin later in the evening. The moisture content of the grains should not be higher than 9 %. Fill-in the bin to full capacity and tight the lid properly. Do not open the bin for the first 30 days and thereafter open it fortnightly. The cover should be replaced immediately after use.
