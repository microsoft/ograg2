What is the recommended moisture level for harvesting wheat and what happens if it is harvested when fully ripe?,"[""{'Crop name': 'Wheat', 'Crop harvesting_guidelines_are': 'When the moisture level of grain is 25% it is the proper time for manual harvesting. Generally, wheat is manually harvested but for quick harvesting, combine harvester should be used to avoid losses in grain yield due to shattering and lodging. Wheat should be harvested 4-5 days before it is dead ripe. Morning is the best time for harvesting. Mechanical harvesting through combine machine is done at places where uniform ripening of wheat happens. In case of manual harvesting, bundles are made and dried for 3-4 days and threshed by thresher.
