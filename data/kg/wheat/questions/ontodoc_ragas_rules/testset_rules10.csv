1. **Identify the Farm Area:**
   - The data does not specify the exact farm area for the North Eastern Plains Zone. However, based on the rules provided, we can assume a standard farm area. Since the rules mention specific areas for North Eastern Hill and North Plain Hill zones, and no specific area is given for the North Eastern Plains Zone, we will assume a typical farm size of 1 hectare for calculation purposes.

2. **Calculate Herbicide Requirement:**
   - Recommended herbicide quantity = 3 kg per hectare
   - Farm area = 1 hectare
   - Total herbicide required = 3 kg/ha * 1 ha = 3 kg

3. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - CO2e emissions per kg of herbicide range from 18.22 to 26.63 kg.
   - Minimum CO2e emissions = 3 kg * 18.22 kg CO2e/kg = 54.66 kg CO2e
   - Maximum CO2e emissions = 3 kg * 26.63 kg CO2e/kg = 79.89 kg CO2e

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The total CO2e emissions from herbicide production for a farm in the North Eastern Plains Zone range from 54.66 kg to 79.89 kg.

Therefore, the total CO2e emissions from herbicide production for the farm are between 54.66 kg and 79.89 kg."

1. **Identify the Recommended Herbicide and Quantity:**
   - Herbicide: Sulfosulfuron
   - Recommended Quantity: 25 gm a.i. /ha

2. **Determine the Farm Area:**
   - According to the rules, the farm area in the North Eastern Plains Zone is 1 hectare.

3. **Calculate the Total Herbicide Required:**
   - Total Herbicide = Farm Area × Recommended Quantity
   - Total Herbicide = 1 ha × 25 gm/ha = 25 gm

4. **Convert Grams to Kilograms:**
   - 25 gm = 0.025 kg

5. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - CO2e Emissions per kg of herbicide = 18.22 to 26.63 kg of CO2e
   - Total CO2e Emissions = 0.025 kg × (18.22 to 26.63 kg CO2e/kg)

6. **Calculate the Range of CO2e Emissions:**
   - Lower Range: 0.025 kg × 18.22 kg CO2e/kg = 0.4555 kg CO2e
   - Upper Range: 0.025 kg × 26.63 kg CO2e/kg = 0.66575 kg CO2e

**Answer:**
The total CO2e emissions from herbicide production for a farm located in the North Eastern Plains Zone is between 0.4555 kg and 0.66575 kg of CO2e."

1. **Identify the Farm Area:**
   - According to the rules, the farm area in the North Eastern Plains Zone is not explicitly given, but we can assume it follows the same pattern as the North Eastern Hill zone, which is 1 hectare (ha).

2. **Calculate Herbicide Production:**
   - Recommended herbicide quantity = 3 kg/ha
   - Farm area = 1 ha
   - Total herbicide production = 3 kg/ha * 1 ha = 3 kg

3. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - CO2e emissions per kg of herbicide = 18.22 to 26.63 kg of CO2e
   - Minimum CO2e emissions = 3 kg * 18.22 kg CO2e/kg = 54.66 kg CO2e
   - Maximum CO2e emissions = 3 kg * 26.63 kg CO2e/kg = 79.89 kg CO2e

**Answer:**
The total CO2e emissions from herbicide production for a wheat farm located in the North Eastern Plains Zone are between 54.66 kg and 79.89 kg of CO2e."

   - **Clean the Bin:** Thoroughly clean the storage bin, ensuring no leftover grains remain.
   - **Inspect Covers:** Check covers and gaskets to ensure they are intact.
   - **Sort Grains:** Clean and sort grains to remove impurities and broken kernels.
   - **Avoid Mixing:** Do not mix new grains with old stock to prevent insect infestation.
   - **Dry Grains:** Ensure grains are dried to a moisture content below 9% before storage.
   - **Fill and Secure:** Fill the bin to full capacity and secure the lid properly.
   - **Initial Storage:** Do not open the bin for the first 30 days.
   - **Regular Checks:** Open the bin fortnightly after the initial period.
   - **Immediate Replacement:** Replace the cover immediately after use and inspect grains frequently.

1. **Identify the Recommended Quantity of Chlorpyrifos:**
   - The recommended quantity is 2.5 ml/litre of water.

2. **Determine the Farm Area:**
   - According to the rules, the farm area in the North Eastern Hill zone is 1 hectare.

3. **Calculate the Total Quantity of Chlorpyrifos Needed:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the total volume of water used, we assume a standard application rate. For simplicity, let's assume 1 litre of water per square meter, which is 10,000 litres for 1 hectare.
   - Total Chlorpyrifos needed = 2.5 ml/litre × 10,000 litres = 25,000 ml = 25 litres.

4. **Convert the Volume to Weight:**
   - Assume the density of Chlorpyrifos is approximately 1 kg/litre (this is a common approximation for liquid pesticides).
   - Total weight of Chlorpyrifos = 25 kg.

5. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - Insecticide production of 1 kg amounts to 14.79 to 18.91 kg of CO2e.
   - CO2e emissions range = 25 kg × 14.79 kg CO2e/kg to 25 kg × 18.91 kg CO2e/kg.

6. **Calculate the Range:**
   - Lower bound = 25 kg × 14.79 kg CO2e/kg = 369.75 kg CO2e.
   - Upper bound = 25 kg × 18.91 kg CO2e/kg = 472.75 kg CO2e.

The total CO2e emissions from the use of Chlorpyrifos for pest control on a 1-hectare farm in the North Eastern Hill zone range from 369.75 kg to 472.75 kg CO2e."

1. **Calculate Herbicide CO2e Emissions:**
   - Farm area in Northern Hills Zone = 1 hectare.
   - Recommended herbicide quantity = 3 kg/ha.
   - Total herbicide used = 3 kg.
   - CO2e emissions from herbicide = 3 kg × (18.22 to 26.63 kg CO2e/kg).
   - Minimum CO2e from herbicide = 3 × 18.22 = 54.66 kg CO2e.
   - Maximum CO2e from herbicide = 3 × 26.63 = 79.89 kg CO2e.

2. **Calculate Insecticide CO2e Emissions:**
   - Insecticide used = 2 kg.
   - CO2e emissions from insecticide = 2 kg × (14.79 to 18.91 kg CO2e/kg).
   - Minimum CO2e from insecticide = 2 × 14.79 = 29.58 kg CO2e.
   - Maximum CO2e from insecticide = 2 × 18.91 = 37.82 kg CO2e.

3. **Calculate Fungicide CO2e Emissions:**
   - Fungicide used = 1.5 kg.
   - CO2e emissions from fungicide = 1.5 kg × (11.94 to 29.19 kg CO2e/kg).
   - Minimum CO2e from fungicide = 1.5 × 11.94 = 17.91 kg CO2e.
   - Maximum CO2e from fungicide = 1.5 × 29.19 = 43.785 kg CO2e.

4. **Total CO2e Emissions:**
   - Minimum total CO2e = 54.66 + 29.58 + 17.91 = 102.15 kg CO2e.
   - Maximum total CO2e = 79.89 + 37.82 + 43.785 = 161.495 kg CO2e.

1. **Identify the Farm Area:**
   - According to the rules, the farm area in the North Eastern Plains Zone is 1 hectare.

2. **Determine the Recommended Herbicide Quantity:**
   - The recommended quantity of Propiconazole is 1 ml/litre of water.

3. **Calculate the Total Herbicide Quantity Needed:**
   - Since the farm area is 1 hectare, and the recommended quantity is 1 ml/litre, we assume a standard application rate. For simplicity, let's assume 1 litre of water is used per square meter, which is 10,000 litres per hectare.
   - Total Propiconazole needed = 1 ml/litre × 10,000 litres = 10,000 ml = 10 litres.

4. **Convert Litres to Kilograms:**
   - Assume the density of Propiconazole is approximately 1 kg/litre (this is a common assumption for liquid herbicides unless specified otherwise).
   - Total Propiconazole in kg = 10 kg.

5. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - Use the conversion factors for herbicide production: 18.22 to 26.63 kg of CO2e per kg of herbicide.
   - Minimum CO2e emissions = 10 kg × 18.22 kg CO2e/kg = 182.2 kg CO2e.
