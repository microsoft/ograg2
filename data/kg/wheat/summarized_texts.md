Wheat is used for food production and has specific growing zones including the Northern Hills Zone, North Western Plains Zone, North Eastern Plains Zone, Central Zone, Peninsular Zone, and Southern Hills Zone. Each zone has specific regions and seed recommendations with a seeding rate of 100 kg per hectare and varying fertilizer application requirements of NPK at different quantities and stages. Wheat requires temperatures of 20-23°C for germination, and excessively high or low temperatures and drought during flowering and grain filling are harmful, with temperatures above 25°C during grain filling and development period tending to depress grain weight. The soil should be clay loam or loam texture with good structure and moderate water holding capacity, avoiding very porous and excessively drained soils, heavy soil with poor structure and poor drainage. Land preparation involves leveling the field, ploughing, harrowing, planking, and irrigating if needed. A seed germination test is essential to ensure a minimum of 85% germination for good yield. Seed fungicide requirements include Carboxin, Carbendazim, Tebuconazole, and Trichoderma viride in specified quantities. Seed sowing should have a spacing of 20-22 cm for timely sown and 15-18 cm for late sown, at a depth of 4 to 5 cm using the broadcasting method. Weed management targets specific weeds with various herbicides. The irrigation schedule requires 4 to 6 applications at specific growth stages. Disease treatments target diseases like Yellow Rust, Brown or Leaf Rust, Loose Smut, Karnal Bunt, Powdery Mildew, and Flag Smut with specific herbicides. Pest treatments address pests like Termite, Aphids, and Pink Stem Borer with pesticides like Thiamethoxam, Fipronil, Imidacloprid, and Quinalphos. Harvesting guidelines emphasize harvesting at proper maturity to minimize risks, and storage guidelines stress proper practices to avoid post-harvest losses.
Wheat, a crop, has two types: Zero tillage, where wheat seed and fertilizers are directly placed at proper depth into the undisturbed soil after rice harvesting using a specially designed machine that creates narrow slits by the knife type furrow openers of zero tillage ferti-seed drill instead of shovel type furrow opener in conventional ferti-seed drill, and Happy seeder, a tractor-mounted machine that cuts and lifts paddy straw, sows wheat seed into the bare soil, and deposits the straw over the sown area as mulch. It grows in several zones including North Western Plains Zone covering Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand with recommended varieties like KRL 19, PBW 502, and others, having early sowing from 1st November to 20th November, late sowing from 25th November to 30th November, seeding rate of 100 kg/ha, and nitrogen application of 120 kg/ha at sowing. Other zones include North Eastern Plains Zone, Central Zone, Peninsular Zone, Northern Hills Zone, and Southern Hills Zone, each with specific regions, seed varieties, sowing times, seeding rates, and fertilizer requirements. Wheat requires temperatures of 10-15°C for germination, 20-25°C for flowering, 15-20°C for grain filling, and is negatively affected by temperatures above 35°C. It thrives in well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter, avoiding sandy types. Land preparation involves placing wheat seed and fertilizers at proper depth into undisturbed soil after rice harvesting. Seed fungicide requirements include Carbendazim at 2 gm/kg of seeds. Sowing should be done in winter with a spacing of 15-20 cm, depth of 3-4 cm, using the drilling method. Weed management includes using herbicides like Clodinafop and others at specified quantities and stages. Irrigation should be scheduled at stages like CRI Stage and others, totaling 5-6 irrigations. Disease treatments for Rust, Smut, and Blight involve using Propiconazole at the time of disease appearance. Pest treatments for Aphids, Termites, and Cutworms involve using Chlorpyrifos at the time of pest appearance. Harvesting guidelines suggest harvesting when grain moisture is 25%, using methods like manual harvesting or combine harvester, and ensuring grain is dried to below 12% moisture before storage. Storage guidelines recommend using bins and silos, ensuring cleanliness, sorting grains, and maintaining moisture content below 9%, with frequent inspections.
