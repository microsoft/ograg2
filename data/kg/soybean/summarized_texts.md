Soybean, a legume used for food and oil, grows in Central India's crop growing zone which includes Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. It has specific seed varieties recommended such as JS 335, JS 95-60, and JS 93-05 with early sowing from June 25 to July 5, and late sowing from July 25 to August 10. The seeding rate is 30 kg per hectare and requires 20 kg per hectare of nitrogen at the time of sowing. The temperature requirements for germination are between 25-30°C, for flowering 20-25°C, and for grain filling 20-25°C, with temperatures above 35°C having a negative effect. Soybean thrives in well-drained loamy to clayey loam soil, rich in organic matter, with moderate water holding capacity, and should avoid sandy soil. Land preparation involves thorough ploughing and planking to achieve a fine tilth stage at field capacity. Seeds should have more than 80% germination and be treated with Thiram or Carbendazim at 2 g per kg of seeds. Sowing should be done in the Kharif season at a spacing of 30 cm x 10 cm and a depth of 3-4 cm using the dibbling method. Weed management includes controlling Phalaris minor and other grass, broadleaf, and sedge weeds using Glyphosate at 1.0 kg per hectare post-emergence. Irrigation should be 500-600 mm during the flowering and pod development stage. Disease treatments for charcoal rot involve using Carbendazim at 2 g per litre of water at the time of sowing, and pest treatments for tobacco caterpillar involve using Quinalphos at 2 ml per litre of water during the larval stage. Harvesting should occur when 85-90% of pods turn brown and hard, and storage should be in a cool and dry place.
Soybean, a crop used for food, feed, and oil, is grown in Madhya Pradesh's regions such as Indore, Bhopal, and Gwalior. It has specific seed varieties like JS 335, JS 95-60, and JS 93-05, with recommended early sowing from June 1 to June 30 and late sowing from July 1 to July 31. The seeding rate is 60-80 kg/ha, and nitrogen should be applied at 20 kg at sowing. The crop requires temperatures between 15-30°C for germination, 20-30°C for flowering, and 20-25°C for grain filling, with temperatures above 35°C having negative effects. It thrives in well-drained loamy or sandy soils, rich in organic matter, and should avoid clayey types. Land preparation involves ploughing 2-3 times, leveling, and adding well-decomposed farmyard manure, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Seeds need a germination rate of at least 80%, and fungicide Thiram should be applied at 2-3 g/kg. Sowing should be done in June-July, with a spacing of 30-45 cm between rows and 5 cm within a row at a depth of 3-4 cm using the dibbling method. Weed management targets broadleaf weeds and grasses like Amaranthus, Echinochloa, and Phalaris, using herbicides such as Pendimethalin and Imazethapyr, among others, applied at various stages. Irrigation of 500-600 mm is crucial during the flowering and pod filling stage. Diseases like Anthracnose and Yellow Mosaic Virus, and pests such as White Grub and Gram Pod Borer, are managed through specific treatments. Harvesting should occur when 85-90% of pods have turned brown with a seed moisture content of 10-12%, and storage should be in a cool, dry place using hermetic bags for long-term storage.
Soybean, a crop used for food and feed, has specific cultivation requirements across various growing zones. In the North Eastern Hill zone, it is recommended to sow varieties JS 20-116 and JS 20-94 between 15th and 30th June with a seeding rate of 55 kg per hectare. Fertilization should include 25 kg of N, 100 kg of P, 50 kg of K, and 50 kg of S per hectare at the time of sowing. In the North Plain zone, the same varieties should be sown between 20th June and 5th July with a seeding rate of 65 kg per hectare, and fertilization should include 25 kg of N, 75 kg of P, 25 kg of K, and 37.5 kg of S per hectare. The Eastern zone follows the North Eastern Hill zone's schedule and fertilization requirements. In the Central zone, sowing should occur between 20th June and 5th July with a seeding rate of 65 kg per hectare, and fertilization should include 25 kg of N, 60 kg of P, 40 kg of K, and 20 kg of S per hectare. The Southern zone should sow between 15th and 30th June with a seeding rate of 65 kg per hectare, and fertilization should include 25 kg of N, 80 kg of P, 20 kg of K, and 30 kg of S per hectare. Soybean requires temperatures between 15-30°C for germination, 20-30°C for flowering and grain filling, and is negatively affected by temperatures above 35°C or below 10°C. The soil should be well-drained loamy to clayey loam, avoiding sandy and heavy black soils, with medium water and nutrient holding capacity. Land preparation should include deep ploughing during summer after harvesting the Rabi crop to expose hibernating insects and facilitate nutrient movement and soil water infiltration. Seed germination tests are advised to ensure a minimum of 70% germination for good yield. Seed fungicide treatment with Penflufen + Trifloxystrobine 38 FS at 1 ml/kg seed is required. Sowing should be done after the arrival of monsoon with 30-45 cm row spacing at a depth of 3 cm using traditional or modern sowing tools. Weed management should target various broadleaf weeds, grassy weeds, and sedges with pre-emergence herbicides as per label instructions. Irrigation should be scheduled as per crop requirement at critical growth stages like seedling, flowering, and pod filling. Disease and pest treatments should be applied as per occurrence with various control measures as per label instructions. Harvesting should be timed with the initiation of pod color change when moisture content is around 14-16%. Storage should be in a cool, aerated, insect-free environment with soybean bags kept upright and stacked up to 4-5 bags of not more than 5 feet height on a platform to maintain seed viability and germination.
Soybean, a crop, has various types used for cultivation including RVS 2002RVS -4, RVS-18, JS 20-69, NRC 86, RKS 45, RKS 24, and MAUS 158. It grows in the Central Zone, which includes regions like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The seed varieties have specific sowing times and seeding rates; for instance, RVS 2002RVS -4 and RVS-18 have a seeding rate of 24 quintals per hectare with sowing times throughout 2017, JS 20-69 has a seeding rate of 23 quintals per hectare with sowing times throughout 2016, NRC 86 has a seeding rate of 24 quintals per hectare with sowing times throughout 2015, RKS 45 has a seeding rate of 28 quintals per hectare with sowing times throughout 2013, RKS 24 has a seeding rate of 30 quintals per hectare with sowing times throughout 2011, and MAUS 158 has a seeding rate of 22 quintals per hectare with sowing times throughout 2010. The crop has no specific temperature, soil, land preparation, seed germination test, seed fungicide, seed sowing spacing, irrigation, or weed management requirements listed. It is susceptible to diseases like RUST, which can be controlled using Hexaconazole 5% EC at the initial stage, and pests like YELLOW MOSAIC VIRUS (YMV), controlled using Thiamethoxam 30 FS and Imidacloprid 48 FS. No specific harvesting or storage guidelines are provided.
