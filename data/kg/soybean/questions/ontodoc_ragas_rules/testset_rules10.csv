1. **Determine the Seeding Rate:**
   - The recommended seeding rate for the North Plain zone is 65 kg per hectare.

2. **Calculate Total Seed Requirement:**
   - For a 2-hectare farm: \( 65 \, \text{kg/ha} \times 2 \, \text{ha} = 130 \, \text{kg} \).

3. **Assume Herbicide Quantity:**
   - Assume 1 kg of herbicide per 65 kg of seed, so for 130 kg of seed, use 2 kg of herbicide.

4. **Calculate Chemical Quantities:**
   - Herbicide: 2 kg.
   - Insecticide: 2 kg.
   - Fungicide: 2 kg.

5. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - **Herbicide CO2e:**
     - Average CO2e per kg = \( \frac{18.22 + 26.63}{2} = 22.425 \, \text{kg CO2e/kg} \).
     - Total = \( 2 \, \text{kg} \times 22.425 \, \text{kg CO2e/kg} = 44.85 \, \text{kg CO2e} \).

   - **Insecticide CO2e:**
     - Average CO2e per kg = \( \frac{14.79 + 18.91}{2} = 16.85 \, \text{kg CO2e/kg} \).
     - Total = \( 2 \, \text{kg} \times 16.85 \, \text{kg CO2e/kg} = 33.7 \, \text{kg CO2e} \).

   - **Fungicide CO2e:**
     - Average CO2e per kg = \( \frac{11.94 + 29.19}{2} = 20.565 \, \text{kg CO2e/kg} \).
     - Total = \( 2 \, \text{kg} \times 20.565 \, \text{kg CO2e/kg} = 41.13 \, \text{kg CO2e} \).

6. **Sum the Emissions:**
   - Total CO2e emissions = 44.85 + 33.7 + 41.13 = 119.68 kg CO2e.

**Answer: 119.68 kg CO2e**"

1. **Calculate CO2e Emissions:**
   - The farmer's field is 1 hectare in the North Eastern Hill zone.
   - Recommended fungicide quantity for RUST = 2 kg per hectare.
   - Total fungicide used = 1 hectare * 2 kg = 2 kg.
   - CO2e emissions range for fungicide = 11.94 to 29.19 kg CO2e per kg of fungicide.
   - Total CO2e emissions = 2 kg * (11.94 to 29.19 kg CO2e/kg) = 23.88 to 58.38 kg CO2e.

2. **Storage Best Practices:**
   - Store soybean seeds in a cool, dry place.
   - Use hermetic storage bags for long-term storage to prevent moisture and pest entry.
   - Ensure the storage area is insect-free and has proper aeration to maintain seed quality.
   - Stack soybean bags upright, up to 4-5 bags high, not exceeding 5 feet, using a platform to maintain seed viability and prevent damage.

By following these guidelines, the farmer can minimize environmental impact and ensure the quality and viability of the soybean seeds post-harvest."

1. **Identify the Recommended Quantities:**
   - Thiamethoxam: 10 mL/kg seed
   - Imidachloprid: 1.25 mL/kg seed

2. **Calculate Herbicide Production:**
   - For Thiamethoxam: Since the farm area is 1 hectare, the required quantity is 10 mL.
   - For Imidachloprid: Since the farm area is 1 hectare, the required quantity is 1.25 mL.

3. **Convert to CO2e Emissions:**
   - Convert mL to kg (assuming density of herbicides is similar to water, 1 mL = 1 g = 0.001 kg):
     - Thiamethoxam: 10 mL = 0.01 kg
     - Imidachloprid: 1.25 mL = 0.00125 kg

   - Use the conversion factor for herbicide production (1 kg amounts to 18.22 to 26.63 kg of CO2e):
     - Thiamethoxam CO2e: 0.01 kg × 18.22 to 26.63 kg CO2e/kg = 0.1822 to 0.2663 kg CO2e
     - Imidachloprid CO2e: 0.00125 kg × 18.22 to 26.63 kg CO2e/kg = 0.022775 to 0.0332875 kg CO2e

4. **Sum the CO2e Emissions:**
   - Total CO2e emissions = Thiamethoxam CO2e + Imidachloprid CO2e
   - Total CO2e emissions = (0.1822 to 0.2663) + (0.022775 to 0.0332875)
   - Total CO2e emissions = 0.204975 to 0.2995875 kg CO2e

**Answer:**

The total CO2e emissions from the production of the required herbicides for seed treatment range from 0.204975 to 0.2995875 kg CO2e."

2. **Determine the Recommended Herbicide and Quantity:**
   - The recommended herbicide for controlling Charcoal rot is Carbendazim.
   - The quantity is 2 g per litre of water.

3. **Calculate the Total Herbicide Quantity:**
   - Since the farm area is 1 hectare, and the recommendation is 2 g per litre, we assume a standard application rate. For simplicity, let's assume 1 litre of water per square meter, which is 10,000 litres per hectare.
   - Total herbicide quantity = 2 g/litre × 10,000 litres = 20,000 g = 20 kg.

### Step 1: Calculate the total quantity of each pesticide used.

- **Herbicide**: 
  - Recommended quantity = 3 kg per hectare
  - Total for 2 hectares = 3 kg/ha * 2 ha = 6 kg

- **Insecticide**: 
  - Recommended quantity = 2 kg per hectare
  - Total for 2 hectares = 2 kg/ha * 2 ha = 4 kg

- **Fungicide**: 
  - Recommended quantity = 1.5 kg per hectare
  - Total for 2 hectares = 1.5 kg/ha * 2 ha = 3 kg

### Step 2: Calculate the CO2e emissions for each pesticide.

- **Herbicide CO2e Emissions**:
  - Emission factor = 18.22 to 26.63 kg CO2e per kg
  - Total emissions = 6 kg * (18.22 to 26.63 kg CO2e/kg) = 109.32 to 159.78 kg CO2e

- **Insecticide CO2e Emissions**:
  - Emission factor = 14.79 to 18.91 kg CO2e per kg
  - Total emissions = 4 kg * (14.79 to 18.91 kg CO2e/kg) = 59.16 to 75.64 kg CO2e

- **Fungicide CO2e Emissions**:
  - Emission factor = 11.94 to 29.19 kg CO2e per kg
  - Total emissions = 3 kg * (11.94 to 29.19 kg CO2e/kg) = 35.82 to 87.57 kg CO2e

### Step 3: Calculate the total CO2e emissions.

- **Total CO2e Emissions**:
  - Minimum total = 109.32 + 59.16 + 35.82 = 204.30 kg CO2e
  - Maximum total = 159.78 + 75.64 + 87.57 = 322.99 kg CO2e
