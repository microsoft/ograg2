      "disease_symptoms": "Disease is incited by Macrophomina phaseolina fungus, which also causes dry root rot, ashy or stem blight. The infection of soybean usually occurs early in the season during seedling emergence and early growth stages. These seedling infections remain latent until environmental stresses (drought and high ambient temperatures ranging from 30-40oC) occur during the R1 (flowering) -R7 (mature pod) growth stages which may cause yield loss up to 77%. Imbalanced fertilizer application and high plant density influence disease prevalence and severity. The pathogen is soil and seed borne. Infected plants produce slightly smaller leaflets than healthy plants and have reduced vigor. As the disease advances, leaflets turn yellow followed by browning and wilting. The brown leaves remain attached to the petioles. A light gray of silver discoloration is visible in the taproot and lower stem, when plants are split open. Black specs (microsclerotia) will be visible in this tissue of the stem and tap root.",

The yellow discoloration slowly increases and newly formed leaves may completely turn yellow. Infected leaves also show severe mottling and crinkling of leaves. The infected plants normally mature late and bear a very few flowers and pods. The pods are small and distorted. The early infection causes death of the plant before seed set. The infection results in decrease in oil. The virus is sap transmitted and spread by white fly Bemisia tabaci in semi persistence manner.",
