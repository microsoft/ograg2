The disease symptoms developing on affected grain are of different types depending on stages of infection of the grain and association of different types of fungi land bacteria. The symptoms may be found in the form of dark brown discolouration, necrotic spots, eye shaped elliptical lesion, linear streaks and tip discolouration. The kernel from affected whole seeds become black and shriveled and can easily be cracked. The disease symptoms affect seed germination and grain weight reducing its commercial value to a large extent."
