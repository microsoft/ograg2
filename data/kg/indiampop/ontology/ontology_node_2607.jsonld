However, trees are left to provide shade as large cardamom prefers shady conditions. Individual pits can also be prepared with a size of 1ftx1ftx1ft at spacing of 6”x6” both ways and are filled with compost or FYM (8-10 kg) alongwith topsoil on the onset of monsoon. However for Golsey variety, a spacing of 5”x5: should be maintained. While planting, healthy rhizomes or suckers are separated from mother plants and transplanted in the pits and soil is pressed well."
