These palms are to be given special care so that they can catch up with the rest of the plantations. Early production of more female inflorescences in the initial 30 months, is an indication of high yielders and all those that fail to produce female bunches will remain as poor yielders. However, replacements are found to be affected to some extent by the vigorous growth of the neighbouring palms which will shade the replanted palms."
