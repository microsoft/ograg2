Further irrigations at intervals of 7 - 10 and 10 - 15 days during summer and winter season respectively may be given depending on soil and weather conditions. Soyabean is very sensitive to excess moisture and the crop is affected, if water stagnates in the fields. The crop should not suffer due to water stress from flowering to maturity. To alleviate moisture stress spray of either Kaolin 3% or liquid paraffin at 1% on the foliage. In Erode district Soybean + castor with irrigation at 0.60 IW/CPE ratio (i.e.) once in 10 to 12 days is recommended to realise maximum benefits.",
