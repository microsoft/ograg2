However, the initial cutting should not be done until the trunk has attained at least 3 cm diameter or the plant has completed one seed production cycle. Harvests can be repeated once in 40 - 80 days depending upon growth and season. In drought prone areas, allow the trees to grow for two years to ensure deep root penetration before commencing harvest. The trees can be cut at 90 to 100 cm height from ground level. For poles and fuel, allow the tree to grow straight without cutting for 2.5 or 5 years as the case may be."
