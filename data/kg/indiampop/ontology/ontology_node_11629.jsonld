The field should be properly prepared to obtain a clean, friable and levelled seed bed to facilitate line sowing. Divide the field into small basins of convenient size (5 x 3 meter) for controlled irrigation. Field channels may be laid in alternate plots so that each channel can irrigate the plots on either side of it. Excess irrigation is harmful for wheat. Therefore, controlled irrigation by dividing the field into subplots is essential for getting high yield.",
