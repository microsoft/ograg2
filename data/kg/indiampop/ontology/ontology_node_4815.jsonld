            "harvesting_guidelines_are": "Harvesting Sweet potato takes about 4-6 months for maturity. The maturity of tubers is determined by cutting fresh tubers. The surface of immature tubers give a dark greenish colour while in mature tubers, the cut ends dry clearly. Besides, as soon as the leaves start showing pale yellow colour and soil near the base of the plant shows cracks, the harvest should be started. It matures in 120-180 days depending on cultivars, climate and soil type. While digging care should be taken to avoid mechanical injury which affects in storage and quality."
