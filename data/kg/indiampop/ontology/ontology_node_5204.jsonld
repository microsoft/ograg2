Delayed harvesting causes considerable loss by shattering and due to damage by rats and birds. However, early varieties should be harvested 25 days after 50% flowering. Improved sickle should be used for harvesting the crop as it reduces drudgery of the worker and gives 20% more coverage than local sickle. The improved sickles are GAIC sickle (Gujurat Agro Industires Corporation, Ahmedabad), Naveen sickle (CIAE, Bhopal), Dev sickle (Dev industries, Bangalore). For hard soil and non-lodgeed crop, power tiller or tractor front mounted vertical conveyor reaper should be used."
