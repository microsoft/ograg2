Most satisfactory result is obtained by using a hand refractometer by taking the sample from the middle portion of the stalk. If reading is at 20 then the cane is considered matured. The Fehlingâ€™s test for glucose gives better assessment. The glucose value is less than 0.5 % in juice at peak maturity.",
