There should be adequate vegetation for shade purposes, otherwise shade trees should be planted at least one year ahead of the main crop plantation.. Land should also be kept prepared by maintaining the lines and the spacing well ahead before the main crop plantation.. Variety should be selected according to the suitability and adoptability of the location."
