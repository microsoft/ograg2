A metal sheet is pushed 4-5” below the soil to lift the seedlings along with the soil. Single seedling is transplanted within half an hour of lifting to minimize trauma of seedling. In conventional method of transplanting, the root takes “U” turn and takes time to turn downward but in SRI the root takes “L” shape. It requires about 20-22 persons to transplant 1 ac. In case of casualty, the gaps should be replanted immediately.",
