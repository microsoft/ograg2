But many of the pest species of related palm species such as coconut and areca palm, have got adapted to oil palm. Among the 49 species of insects infesting adult oilpalms, 14 species are known pests of coconut and 19 species are known pests of areca palms. Insect pests of oilpalm in India are more or less same as those reported from Malaysia and other South-East Asian countries.",
