Earthing-up is usually done on crops planted on ridges. In sweet potato vines have a tendency to form nodes which result in diversion of some quantity of nutrients for the development of such roots. To save nutrient losses, it is essential to lift and turn the vines, so that they are disconnected from the soil. This operation helps in increasing the tuber yield which is done during early stage of vine growth. However it is not necessary to disturb the vines when they have grown to a considerable length. Though pruning of vines is usually not done, the extra ordinary long vines should be taken up simultaneously when turning of vines or earthing-up is done. The pruned vines are fed to animals which is a good green fodder.",
