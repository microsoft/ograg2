During the ON time water front advances into the furrow over a certain length and during the subsequent OFF time the water applied partially saturates the soil and infiltration rate gets reduced on the advanced length. When water is delivered in the succeeding ON time, the water front advance gets accelerated due to the reduced intake rate and eventually it reaches the tail end of long furrow with in 30 -50% of the design duration of irrigation. This process of ON OFF water supply and cutoff results in highly minimized deep percolation and runoff losses (hardly exceeding 20%). Hence, high uniformity of soil moisture distribution with in the effective root zone is achieved over the entire furrow length resulting in enhanced irrigation efficiencies of more than 85% to 95%. In addition due to the series of long furrows emanating from a single head channel, the criss -cross ridges and feeder channel of division are eliminated thereby limiting the land loss within 5% only."
