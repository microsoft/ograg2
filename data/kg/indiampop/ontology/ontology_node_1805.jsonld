The crop requires less water than rice and about 3 hectares of wheat can be grown with the amount of water required for one hectare of paddy. The command areas of dugwells, lift irrigation points, tanks, MI projects, water harvesting structures and tail end areas of canals offer scope for wheat cultivation. Moreover, a third crop of pulses, ragi or sesame can be taken with light irrigation in summer after harvest of wheat."
