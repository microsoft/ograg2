In Kisan silo, comparatively better anaerobiosis is maintained and the storage life is much longer, even upto six months or more. Once the silo is opened then it has to be used as quickly as possible to avoid spoilage. To reduce spoilage due to aerobiosis, after opening the silo and removing the required quantity of silage, the top must be covered with the excess gunny and polythene and a small weight (brick) may be placed to reduce air entry and to retain compaction."
