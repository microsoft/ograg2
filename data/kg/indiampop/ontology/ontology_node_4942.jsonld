The symptoms are most apparent on at least 5 months old plants although 2-3 months old plant are also killed under highly favourable conditions. The earliest signs of the disease are faint yellow streaks in the petioles of oldest lower most leaf. Two types of symptoms follow this stage. In the yellowing type there is progressive yellowing of the old leaves and eventual collapse at the petiole. In the non yellowing type, the leaf collapses at the petiole without leaf chlorosis. Often all the leaves but the youngest collapses and the heart alone remain upright.",
