At present the single stage polybag nursery is recommended in India. Since the plants are to remain in these polybags for more than one year, good quality polybags of 500 gauge and 40 x 45 cm size are to be used. On the lower half of the bag, perforations are made at an interval of 7.5 cm for drainage. A bag can carry 15 - 18 kg of nursery soil depending on the type of soil mixture used."
