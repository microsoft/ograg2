The pods should be allowed to ripen on the tree until the outer shell is dry and can be separated from the pulp without adherence. Individual pods contain about 3 to 10 seeds covered with pulp. A good full grown tree produces about 2 quintals of fruits per season.",
            "storage_guidelines_are": "The pods are trod by hand and washed in water to separate the seed which is dried in shade and stored. The seeds constitute about one third the weight of the pods. The pulp is about 55 per cent and shell and fibre about 11 per cent of the pod. About 1800-2000 seeds weigh one kilogram."
