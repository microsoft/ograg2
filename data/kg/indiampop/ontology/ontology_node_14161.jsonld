When no basal application is possible, 75% N be applied as first top dressing at the time of interculture (hoeing and weeding) in the third week from germination and the rest 25% at the panicle initiation (PI) stage (18-20 days before panicle emergence). In well drained sandy soil, apply full P as basal and N & K in split. In other soils, apply full P & K as basal and N in splits."
