Application of lime @ 20 qtl/ha 15-20 days before sowing has been shown to be very effective in increasing the lentil yield. One deep ploughing followed by two to three harrowing and plankings should be given to prepare a well pulverized seedbed. In lowland rice fallows with standing water 6-8 inch raised beds of 4-5 meter length and 1.5 meter width should be prepared and soil should be well pulverized.",
