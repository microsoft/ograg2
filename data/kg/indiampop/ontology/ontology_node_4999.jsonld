Initially small dots, with golden yellow colour develop which later it extends to form long streaks. The chlorotic streaks become necrotic giving a blackish appearance on lamina (Fig. 16 & 17). Necrotic streaks appear on midrib, pseudostem and petiole are also observed. The symptoms are erratically distributed over individual leaves as well as in leaves of same plants. The midrib mosaic symptom, one of the symptoms of Banana Mosaic (CMV), is not found with banana streak disease. Bunch choking, abortion of bunch and seediness in fruits are seen in infected plants. Diseases plants may be stunted and fruit may be distorted with a thinner peal and bunches are small in size. Various changes in symptom have been noticed in different varieties. Leaf stripping symptoms are commonly noticed in cultivars Poovan, Grande Nain and Robusta (Fig 18). However, temperature plays a major role in symptoms expression."
