In such soils 25% of nitrogen may be applied at 3 weeks stage, 50% at 45 days stage and the rest by 2 to 3 urea sprays, commencing from 55 to 60 days at 10 days interval. In poor soils 25% of the nitrogen may be applied at sowing and the rest in 3 equal splits at stages indicated above. Top dressing just before hoeing and earthing helps in incorporating the fertilizer into the soil and improves efficiency. Spray Cycocel or Planofix or Celmone 10 ppm at 45 days and 20 ppm 15 days later to prevent boll shedding. Spraying of 1.5% DAP at 75 and 90 DAS & 0.75% DAP+ 0.75% M.O.P at 105 DAS help in better retention."
