Sometimes before harvesting dehaulming is done i.e. about 75 days in early crop and at 85 days in medium duration crop. At the time of harvesting care should be taken for minimum damage to the tuber as damage to the skin reduces the keeping quality. All the tubers are kept in the field for 24 hours for hardening of the skin. Damaged and diseased tubers are discarded."
