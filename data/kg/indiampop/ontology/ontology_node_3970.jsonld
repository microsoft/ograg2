Six to eight such beds are required for transplanting 1 bigha. Low polytunnel (height: 75cm, width: 125cm, length: as per convenience) should be used for raising seedlings during cold period (end of December to mid January). Polytunnel is a portable structure constructed with polythene sheet fixed on to a frame made of bamboo sticks. The structure is placed over the seedlings on the seed bed to ensure favourable temperature for the growing seedlings. Any gap between the polytunnel and the soil should be sealed with mud, to maintain warmth inside the tunnel during night. The structure should be removed for 1-2 hrs daily, starting from the 7th day before uprooting in order to allow the seedlings to acclimatize. The duration of removal should be increased gradually and the seedlings should finally be kept completely exposed for about 2 days."
