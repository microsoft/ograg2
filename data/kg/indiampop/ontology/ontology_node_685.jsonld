All the kokkan affected plants may not show this symptom, but once this symptom is expressed there is no doubt that the particular plant is affected. Necrotic streaks are another important symptom of the disease. The streaks are initially brown, which later turn black. It occurs on all aerial parts of the affected plant except on lamina, the length being a few mm to 10 cm. All the kokkanaffected plants will exhibit the necrotic streaks from third month onwards at one stage or other. Some of the affected plants retain the necrotic streaks throughout the growth period. In certain cases it disappears with the senescence of the affected portion.",
