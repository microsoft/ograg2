Physiological maturity in castor is attained when any of the capsules in the spike turns brown in colour. The main spike is ready for harvest within 90-120 days after sowing. The subsequent pickings can be taken up at an interval of 30 days. The mature spikes are cut preferably in morning hours and dried in sun for few days for easy threshing. Threshing is usually done by either beating the capsules with stick or alternatively by trampling with bullocks."
