Seed viability is impaired when pods are dried at 40oC or higher. Dry the uprooted plants under shade till the pods produce rattling sound. Store the pods in polythene lined gunny bags in a well ventilated room. Anhydrous CaCl2 @ 250 g/30 kg bag may be used as a desiccant. In storage, the stack base should be on raised stands. Stacks should not be more than 10 bags piled one over the other. The pile of bags has to be kept 4-5 feet below the roof and separated from the wall to allow free circulation of air."
