One side of the sheet (7 x 6 cm) will be smooth and the other will be eruptive. Streak 50% honey solution on the smooth side by using a camel hair brush. Then fold the sheet in such a way that the honey-smeared surface is on the inside and the eruptive surface outside and staple it. The gap between the dotted holes will provide free movement for the adults, which imbibe the honey through eruptive surface. In this method, the adults do not get trapped in the honey solution."
