The skin become folded and shrunken as the infection spread slowly along the fingers, grey conidia are formed on the shriveled stalk end of the fruit i.e, like the ash of cigar. The pulp tissue shows typical dry rot that is the characteristic feature of the pathogen. Black pitting and spotting of fruit on account of drying of the finger gives an appearance of a lighted cigar. The pulp undergoes a dry rot and becomes mummified."
