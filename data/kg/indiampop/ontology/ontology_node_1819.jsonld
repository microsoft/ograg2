When the plants are completely yellow and the grains dry up and become hard, wheat will be ready for harvest. One test is to bend the neck of the earhead and if snaps, then wheat is ready for harvesting. Another test is to take a grain and bite it and if it breaks with a cracking sound then the crop is ready for harvest."
