When the bundles are dried, the pods may be detached from the plants and spread in a thin layer under shade for further lowering the pod moisture level to 7-8%. The drying of the pod can be judged from the following tests. (a) The pods should give a rattling sound when shaken. (b) When a karnal is pressed between thumb and index finger, it should easily split into 2 cotyledons. (c) When the surface of the kernel is rubbed hard a portion of the testa should come off."
