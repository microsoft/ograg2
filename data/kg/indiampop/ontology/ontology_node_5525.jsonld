After inundation puddling is to be done as per transplanting. More care should be taken to level the field to zero level. Stagnation of water in patches during germination and early establishment of the crop leads to uneven crop stand. Land leveling has say over efficient weed and water management practices. Provision of shallow trenches (15 cm width) at an interval of 3m all along the field will facilitate the draining of excess water at the early growth stage.",
