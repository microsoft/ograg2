Plant rooted cuttings of 60 cm length in pits of 40 cm cube filled with dry leaves and top soil. They are planted close to the base of the support tree. The top end of the cutting is to be tied to the base of the support tree gently so that it will eventually climb on them. If shade is not sufficient from the support tree, palm fronds or other leaves can be used to provide shade to the cuttings. Longer cuttings bear earlier than shorter cuttings.",
