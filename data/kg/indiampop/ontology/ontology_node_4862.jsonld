Infestation at the early stage reduces the plant vigour. Sick appearance and yellow lines on the top leaves are early symptoms. Where as in advanced stage of infestation, plant show tapering of the stem at crown region, reduction in leaf size, poor bunch formation and choked throat appearance due to grub damage in corms. The weevil spreads through infested suckers to different places.",
