FORMING BEDS  Wherever tractor is engaged, bed former may be used. or  Ridges and furrows may be laid at 60cm spacing between ridges and sowing taken on both sides of the ridge  Raised bed with a width of 60cm and with a furrow of 15cm on either side may be formed and sowing taken on the raised bed Broad beds and furrows method of groundnut cultivation is a proven technology from ICRISAT. Considering the favourable environment in the Broad beds and furrows system for the development of groundnut pods, with a little modification in the size, beds are to be formed for the polyethylene film mulched groundnut. Make the beds at a width of 60 cm, leaving 15 cm on the either side for the furrows. In a plot size of 4.5 m x 6.0 m, five beds can be made. After the formation of the bed and fertilizer application, spread black polythene sheet (90 cm width) over the soil surface. The edges of the polyethylene can be sheet Seven micron polythene film sheet @50 kg/ha is required. Holes can be made at required spacing of 30 x10 cm before spreading of the sheets. The seed requirement is similar to normal groundnut cultivation",
