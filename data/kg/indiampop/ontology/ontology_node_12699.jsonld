Seed should be attached to the seedling and transplanted as soon as possible after being removed from the nursery within 15 minutes or half an hour to avoid dessication and traumatization of the plant. While transplanting, the root tips are not inverted, hence, do not thrust seedlings downwards. Each seedlings should be slipped into the soil very gently and close to the surface so that its roots lie horizontally in the moist soil.",
