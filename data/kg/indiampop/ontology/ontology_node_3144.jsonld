Land preparation should ensure that all crop residues, crop volunteers and weeds are completely buried. Summer ploughing is advantageous to kill the weed seeds and hibernating insects and disease organisms by exposing them to the heat of summer. Initial ploughing should be carried out at optimum moisture range to get good tilth and should avoid when moisture is in excess. For rainy season crop, with onset of rains in May-June, the field is ploughed once or twice to obtain a good tilth.Harrowing of soil should invariably follow after each ploughing to reduce the clod size.",
