When the crop is 4 to 5 months old, remove borer affected tillers and late formed tillers, tie the cane shoots in two’s or three’s with the partially dried lower leaves. Remove the late tillers and water shoots formed from October onwards as these tillers do not mature in time and spoil the quality of juice if crushed along with the main crop."
