The pod is mature when it becomes hard and there is dark tannin discolouration inside the shell. The seed becomes unwrinkled and the testa develops colour. A common method used to predict optimum time for harvesting is to dig plants when 75% of the pods are fully mature. Generally, rabi groundnut (bunch varieties) matures at 125-130 days, while summer groundnut (bunch varieties) matures at the age of 115-120 days."
