The characteristic symptom of the disease on leaves is the yellow halo that surrounds lesion. Young lessons are raised or pustular, particularly on the lower leaf surface. The pustules later became corky and crateriform, with a raised margin and a sunken centre. Lesions on fruit and stems extend 1-3 mm in depth and are superficially similar to those on leaves (Fig. 22 & 23).",
